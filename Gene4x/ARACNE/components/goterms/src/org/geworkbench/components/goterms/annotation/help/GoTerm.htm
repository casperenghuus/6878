       <h3>Gene Ontology</h3> 
    <p>The Gene Ontology component is located in the View Area in the top-right panel of the application. This component provides categorization of genes in terms of function their products perform, their cellular localization or involvement in high level biological processes. The actual category definitions are provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium (<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org</a> ) which we make use of in generating a tree structure which approximates the Directed Acyclic Graph structure used by the Consortium.</p> 
    <p>Specifically, this component computes and provides enrichment statistics using the <a href="Tree View.HTML">Tree View</a>, <a href="Table View.HTML">Table View</a> or<a href="pvalue.HTML"> P-value trends</a> and three tabbed regions in the Graphical User Interface.</p>
