# Tasks
## A
- Swap labels (Casper)

## B
## C

# Main goals
## Re-run their algorithm
Stuck because itâ€™s super slow, might reduce network size more

## Implement more clustering algorithms
### Multi-layer clustering
- Feed individual layers to julia code
- Runs with Julia 0.4.0
- Tensor input file similar

### Bi-partite clustering
- Aggregate into bi-partite graph
- Run scikit co-clustering

### Fancier consensus algorithm
- Mess with the cpp code

## Evaluation code

## Visualization

## Improve existing pipeline
###
