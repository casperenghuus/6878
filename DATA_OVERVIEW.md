# Data

## GSE42509

Contains data for the following:

- RNA-seq and Riboseq of human fibroblasts under the following conditions:
    - Normal proliferation
    - Senescence (early [5d], induced by RAS)
    - Senescence (late [14d], induced by RAS)
    - Quiescence (induced by serum starvation)
    - Cancer (p53 and p16INK4A knockdown, RAS induced, SV40-small-T expression)


## GSE58910

Contains data for hypoxia-induced senescence in astrocytes


## GSE63577

- Contains data for replicative senescence in two different human fibroblast cell lines, MRC-5 and HFF. There are RNA-seq data for the following time points:
    - MRC-5: 32, 42, 52, 62 and 72 passage doublings
    - HFF: 16, 26, 46, 64 and 74 passage doublings
